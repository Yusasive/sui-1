Used Encoding/Decoding or Call Method: call

### Explanation

**Purpose:**  
The `flashLoan` function allows users to borrow assets without collateral, provided that the borrowed amount is returned along with a fee within the same transaction.

**Detailed Usage:**  
The `flashLoan` function uses the `call` method indirectly through the `safeTransfer` function and `executeOperation` function. The `call` method in this context is used to transfer tokens to the `receiverAddress` and then invoke the `executeOperation` function on the `IFlashLoanReceiver` contract. The `call` method provides flexibility and control over the contract interaction, ensuring that the transfer and subsequent operations are handled atomically.

**Impact:**  
The `call` method in this function is crucial for executing the flash loan. It ensures that the assets are transferred securely to the borrower's contract, and the borrower's contract's custom logic is executed correctly. This enables the flash loan functionality, which is a core feature of the Aave protocol, allowing users to leverage arbitrage opportunities, refinance loans, and execute complex financial strategies within a single transaction.
